# Arrested Development: Prevent Your Baby Mods From Growing Up

This is a "vanilla-plus" datapack which allows the player to
prevent baby mobs from aging into adults.

## How to Use

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/ArrestedDevelopment/releases)
and download it to your world's "datapacks" folder.

Once installed, grab a nametag and name any newly-bred mob "baby". That mob should
then glow for a second. Afterwards, it will have its age constantly reset to keep it
from growing into an adult.

If you later on decide that you would like your eternal child to grow into an adult mob,
you can nametag it "grow", and it will begin ageing as usual (it should take about 20 minutes
to grow up, unassisted).


## Compatibility

This datapack has been tested on versions:

- [x] 1.21.6



and should work on all versions in between.
